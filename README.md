This repository contains a simple Python program demonstrating a common error: ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version with error handling.  The error arises when attempting to divide by zero, a mathematically undefined operation. The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error using a `try-except` block to gracefully handle division by zero.
